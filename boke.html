<h1>The littele prince</h1>
<h2>chapter4</h2>
 <p>ihad leaned very much about the litter prince's planet , but ihad learned them dlowly in the coursse of time.</p>
 <p>it the was only after a great dealof reflection that i managed toundestaqnd this particular thing:</p>
 <p>that the planet he came fram was scarcely any larger than a house</p>
 <p>but that did not realy surprise me much.</p>
 <p>iknow vry well that in addition to the great pllanets such as the earth jupiter mars venus to which we have given names there are also hundreds of others som of which are so smsii that one one has a hard time seting them through the telescope</p>
 <p>when an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name but  only a number.</p>
 <p>he might call it for example asteroid 325</p>
 <p>i have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the litter prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.</p>
 <p>this astroid has only once been seen through the telescope.</p>
 <p>that was by a turkish astrnomer in1909</p>
 <p>on making his discovery the the astronomer had presented it to the international astronomical congress in a great demonstration.</p>
 <p>but he was in turkish costume and so nobody would believe what he said.</p>
 <p>grown ups are like that...</p>
